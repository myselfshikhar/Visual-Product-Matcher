📜 Project Overview
The Visual Product Matcher is a sophisticated, AI-powered web application that allows users to find visually similar products from a catalog using an image.

Instead of relying on text-based search, which can be ambiguous, this tool leverages the power of deep learning to understand the visual content of an image and retrieve the closest matches.

This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end implementation of a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system, from feature extraction with a pre-trained neural network to building a fast and efficient similarity search index. The entire application is wrapped in a sleek, interactive, and user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

🚀 Key Features
🖼️ Dual Input Methods: Users can either upload an image file directly or paste a URL to an image on the web.

🧠 Deep Learning Backend: Utilizes the powerful VGG16 convolutional neural network to extract high-level feature vectors from images.

⚡ Efficient Similarity Search: Employs a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm with a cosine similarity metric to instantly find the most similar items.

🎨 Dynamic & Interactive UI: A modern and responsive user interface built with Streamlit, featuring real-time previews and adjustable search parameters.

☁️ Scalable Architecture: Designed to work with remote image URLs stored in a CSV, making it easy to scale the product catalog without local storage.

💡 Problem-Solving & Architecture
The core challenge is to quantify "visual similarity". My approach breaks this down into three main steps:

Feature Extraction (Image to Vector):

An image is represented as a meaningful set of numbers (a feature vector) using the VGG16 model. This vector captures textures, patterns, shapes, and colors.

Indexing for Fast Retrieval:

To avoid slow, sequential searches, a search index is built using scikit-learn's NearestNeighbors. This pre-organizes all vectors for optimized, high-speed lookups.

Cosine Similarity is used as the distance metric, as it excels at comparing high-dimensional vectors.

User Interface & Experience:

Streamlit was selected to rapidly build a beautiful and intuitive Python-based web app, guiding the user seamlessly from input to result.
